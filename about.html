                    For the longest time I have been truly passionate in sport and fitness, having the same goal every 
                    year since I was 9 years old of getting a six pack. At that point I was a tall skinny kid thinking 
                    that endless sit ups in my room was the answer. Until I went to Brockenhurst college and learned 
                    all about the intricacies human body and the scientifically proven way to build muscle, studying 
                    day after day to not only use this on myself but to teach this new found knowledge to my clients.
                    <br><br> 
                    After leaving my sessions you should have a deeper understanding of how to connect mind to the 
                    muscle. Muscle can be trained to adapt to many different things: Increasing confidence with muscle 
                    tone, knowing you fit into your outfits and look great! Increasing endurance so that walking, lifting 
                    and general day to day activities are less tiring! Flexibility, which is directly correlated with 
                    reduced risk of injury, increased recovery and a healthy posture! The body really does work in 
                    amazing ways and can learn all sorts of new things, all it needs is the correct teacher.
